This is just a repo to store some scripts and some handy guides that I had found/wrote for my specific system

## Packages

Originally I had bash scripts in here, but after talking with a friend of mine, switched over to ansible playbooks.

## Single GPU Passthrough for QEMU/KVM

All of this is under the hooks directory. There is a readme within there.

I can verify as of 02/22/2023 that I got it working with 
 - Windows 10
 - Windows 11
 - MacOS Monterey
 - MacOS Ventura
   - Even xcode works on both!
